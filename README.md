SecurePE
========

This repository contains the reimplementation of the EDK II Image Loader
for UEFI environments and the ACSL annotations for its formal verification.

The specifications are developed in the [ACSL](https://frama-c.com/html/acsl.html)
language. Frama-C with [AstraVer](https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/astraver) plugin
is used as the deductive verification tool.

### Papers

M. HÃ¤user and V. Cheptsov, "Securing the EDK II Image Loader," 2020 Ivannikov Ispras Open Conference (ISPRAS), 2020, pp. 16-25, DOI: [0.1109/ISPRAS51486.2020.00010](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPRAS51486.2020.00010). [[ArXiv preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05471)


### Errata
* The publication has incorrectly defined $A\_MAX = 4$ for the IA32 architecture. The correct definition is $A\_MAX = 8$. This furthermore implies that $\_Alignof(UINT64) = 8$ for IA32 architectures. This does not affect the result of the verification.
* The code snapshot has incorrectly defined $RelocsStripped = (TeHdr->DataDirectory[0].Size > 0)$ for TE Images. The correct definition is $RelocsStripped = (TeHdr->DataDirectory[0].Size == 0)$. This bug effectively prevents the Image relocation of TE Images. This does not affect the safety or well-defined behaviour of the code snapshot.
